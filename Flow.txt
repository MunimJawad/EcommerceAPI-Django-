🔹 Current Flow (What you have now)

User adds products → creates Order (completed = False).

User checks out (fills shipping address).

At checkout, you’re marking order.completed = True.

That means your system already thinks the order is done.

But in reality, payment hasn’t happened yet.

🔹 Correct Flow (Industry Standard)

We should separate Checkout and Payment:

Cart Phase → user adds products, order is completed=False.

Checkout Phase → user enters shipping details.

At this point, the order is created, but still not paid.

So order.completed should still be False.

Instead, add a field like is_checkout_done=True.

Payment Phase → user selects payment option (COD, Stripe, PayPal, etc.).

If payment succeeds → set order.completed=True.

If payment fails → order stays incomplete.

🔹 Why This Is Better

✅ Prevents marking unpaid orders as “completed.”

✅ Matches real-world flow (Amazon, Daraz, etc.).

✅ Allows multiple payment methods (COD, card, etc.).

✅ Easier for Admin to see which orders are pending payment vs fully confirmed.
